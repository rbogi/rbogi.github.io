Hi Everyone!

My name is Bogi. In case you were wondering, that's a Hungarian name, although I've lived in Basel, Switzerland for the last few years.

I've worked as a financial analyst and controller for most of my career, but now I'm studying to become a data scientist.

I find that people like me, who are switching to this field often come from a background where they have not been exposed to information technology beyond what is required for the usual office tasks. I think it can be intimidating and somewhat overwhelming to find your way around the many tools and acquire the needed technical skills a data scientist should master.

Hence, I decided to be transparent about my experience, trials and errors, and openly share, in the hope that some of you who are in the same shoes can benefit from it.

Follow me on this journey and I'd love to hear from you as well!

All the best,

Bogi
