So, I had this old laptop that I haven’t used for quite a while, still having Windows 7 as the operating system on it. Being a Windows-only user, for a long time, I wanted to work on my Linux terminal skills and it seemed like a good opportunity to turn the old thing into a Linux workstation. I'm starting a series to tell you all about it. Here's how it went.

As a data scientist, being comfortable with Linux operating systems is generally a good idea, and many data science related software are natively written on Linux anyway, so why not learn to use them in their natural habitat? Also, why not learn a thing or two about how to install and work with software like Docker etc. on Linux? Most of the cloud services run on Linux servers anyway, so it just seems inevitable that I will face this sooner or later. Let's be prepared, I say!

I am a Linux novice myself, so I had to familiarize myself with a couple of things. Here are a few of the key findings I learned:
* Linux is actually the name of the kernel. A kernel is the heart and soul of the operating system, the software that translates between the user and the hardware of the computer.
* Operating systems that are based on Linux are called Linux distributions, or “distros” as the cool kids call them. These are all open source, most of them are free to use and can differ in the desktop environment, applications they offer etc.

So how do you choose from all the [Linux distributions out there](https://distrowatch.com/)? I thought I would go with the most popular one, Ubuntu, for starters. Millions of users cannot be wrong, right? Also, it appears different Linux operating systems have a different way of installation and configuration, and I wanted to have the easiest setup possible, as I do not need to customize all of the different parts of the OS myself.

Turns out, installing an operating system is easier than you’d think. Ubuntu has a server and a desktop version, obviously, I installed Ubuntu Desktop (version 20.04). Following a backup of the system, I just needed to [create a bootable flash drive](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview), plug it in after restart and follow the instructions. Literally, that was it! Also, the [step-by-step documentation](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop) was pretty good.

I recommend this experience even if you consider yourself a “non-technical” user, as re-vamping an old machine like that can be a nice hobby project, giving you a lot more confidence and opening new learning opportunities.

In the posts to follow I will share my experience about setting up my new workstation and telling you all about what I learned.
